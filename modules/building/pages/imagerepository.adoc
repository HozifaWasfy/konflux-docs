= Customizing ImageRepository

== Changing repository visibility
In the ImageRepository change `spec.image.visibility` to `public`(default) or `private` according what you want,
only those two options are valid.

== Rotating credentials for repository
In the ImageRepository add new section `spec.credentials.regenerate-token` with value `true`, repository credentials
will be rotated and pull & push secret updated, section will be removed after rotation and `status.credentials.generationTimestamp` will be updated with new timestamp.

== Verify and fix secrets links in Service Account
If you modified manually SA or removed manually some generated secrets you can fix your SA by adding in
the ImageRepository new section `spec.credentials.verify-linking` with value `true`,
section will be removed after actions are performed.

It will link secret to service account if link is missing.
It will remove duplicate links of secret in service account.
It will remove secret from imagePullSecrets in service account.
It will unlink secret from service account, if secret doesn't exist (you can recreate secret using 'regenerate-token').

== Skip repository deletion
By default when ImageRepository is removed it will also remove repository in quay.io,
if you want to keep it and still remove ImageRepository add to the ImageRepository
new annotation `image-controller.appstudio.redhat.com/skip-repository-deletion` with value `"true"`.
