= Retriggering build pipelines

Occasionally, your build pipeline may fail unexpectedly, necessitating a retrigger. For pull requests, this can be achieved by adding comments. For post-merge builds, retriggering can be done either through UI, or by using the API to add an annotation to your Component resource.

See also xref:/testing/integration/rerunning.adoc[Retriggering integration tests].

== Retriggering a pre-merge build on a pull request

.**Prerequisite**

- You have a build pipeline run on a pull request that has failed, and you want to re-run the build without pushing a new commit.

.**Procedure**

. Add a comment to the pull request with the text `/retest` to trigger a new build.

+
The pipeline run should start executing in the *Activity* > *Pipeline runs* tab and in the pull request

+
NOTE: For additional options, refer to the link:https://pipelinesascode.com/docs/guide/gitops_commands/[pipelinesascode documentation].

== Retriggering a post-merge build from from GitHub

.**Prerequisite**

- You have already merged a pull request, but the subsequent build failed, prompting a need for retriggering.

.**Procedure**

. On the GitHub UI, navigate to the latest commit on your branch that that you want to rebuild.
. Comment `/retest` on the commit. If the commit is not on the default branch, use `/retest branch:<branch-name>`

+
All pipeline runs associated with that commit should resume in the *Activity* > *Pipeline runs* tab.

+
NOTE: This procedure only works to retrigger the build pipeline for the latest commit on the branch.

+
NOTE: For instructions on how to retrigger only individual build pipelines, not all, see link:https://pipelinesascode.com/docs/guide/gitops_commands/[pipelinesascode documentation].

+
NOTE: If you only want to retrigger the integration tests, see xref:/testing/integration/rerunning.adoc[retriggering integration tests].

== Retriggering a post-merge build from your main branch from the UI

.**Prerequisite**

- You have already merged a pull request, but the subsequent build failed, prompting a need for retriggering.
- You didn't rename push pipeline run name, and it is in format `component_name + '-on-push'`

.**Procedure**

In the console, complete the following steps to retrigger the build pipeline:

. Navigate to the *Activity* > *Pipeline runs* tab.
. Identify the pipeline run that you want to retrigger.
. Select the three dots on the right side of the table.
. Select the *Rerun* action.

+
The pipeline run should resume in the *Activity* > *Pipeline runs* tab.

== Retriggering a post-merge build from your main branch from the API

.**Prerequisite**

- You have already merged a pull request, but the subsequent build failed, prompting a need for retriggering.
- You didn't rename push pipeline run name, and it is in format `component_name + '-on-push'`
- You have CLI access to {ProductName}. For information on obtaining CLI access, refer to  xref:ROOT:getting-started.adoc#getting-started-with-the-cli[Getting started in CLI]

.**Procedure**

. Identify the *Component* whose pipeline requires rerun.
. Use the following command to annotate the *Component*, triggering a new build:
+
[source]
----
$ kubectl annotate components/[component name] build.appstudio.openshift.io/request=trigger-pac-build
----

. The build is re-triggered automatically.

+
[source]
----
$ tkn pipelinerun list
