= RapiDAST

In this guide, you'll learn how to xref:/testing/integration/adding.adoc[add a custom integration test] in {ProductName} that uses link:https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/rapidast[RapiDAST] as a third-party tool for dynamic application security testing. 

.Prerequisites

. You have xref:/building/creating.adoc[created an application] in {ProductName}

. You are familiar with link:https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/rapidast?tab=readme-ov-file#rapidast[RapiDAST documentation]

. You have chosen a RapiDAST configuration file and are ready, or have the necessary details, to complete one. Refer to the RapiDAST link:https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/rapidast?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration[documentation] for templates and examples.

. You have selected the scanner you want to use with RapiDAST, ZAP, Nessus or a generic scanner. Refer to the RapiDAST link:https://github.com/redHatProductSecurity/rapidast/?tab=readme-ov-file#scanners[documentation] for available scanners and their configurations.

. You have access to a git repository containing the link:https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/rapidast?tab=readme-ov-file#an-openapi-schema[OpenAPI] specification of your application or another supported entry point (e.g., endpoints, spiders, etc.).

. Optional - You have access to link:https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/rapidast?tab=readme-ov-file#exporting-to-google-cloud-storage[Google Cloud Storage] to facilitate export and storage of scan results.

NOTE: The RapiDAST scan is intended to be used in testing environments, and should not be used on production systems.

.Procedure  

Review the link:https://github.com/jenculltesting/rh-trex-test/blob/main/.tekton/rapidast-scan.yaml[sample integration test]. 

Examine the following tasks/steps provided in the example. Create a new Tekton pipeline of your own that mimics these steps but is modified to fit the needs of your application.  

. Provision Environment  
+  
- Create an ephemeral environment to deploy the application.  

. Deploy Application (deploy-app)  
+  
- Use the provided SNAPSHOT configuration for deployment.  
- Process deployment manifests (e.g., services, secrets, databases) and apply them to the cluster.  
- Retrieve and note the applicationâ€™s URL for further testing.  

. Set Up Testing (setup-test)  
+   
- Configure port-forwarding to securely access the deployed application using a sidecar.  
- Authenticate with the application and obtain an authenticated base URL.  
- Prepare the RapiDAST configuration file for scanning.  

. Run RapiDAST Scan (run-rapidast)  
+    
- Run RapiDAST using the dynamically prepared configuration file.  
- Perform API and active scanning (e.g., ZAP) to generate security reports in JSON and HTML formats.  
- Export the results to the `results/` directory for further analysis. Results may be exported to Google Cloud for storage and retrieval. 

.Verification

When the new build is finished:

. Go to the *Integration tests* tab and select the highlighted name of your test.

. Go to the *Pipeline runs* tab of that test and select the most recent run.

.  On the *Details* page, you can see if the test succeeded for that component. Navigate to the other tabs for more details. 

. xref:/testing/integration/editing.adoc[Edit the integration test] if it is not properly configured.
